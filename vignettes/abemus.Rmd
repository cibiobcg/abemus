**ABEMUS** (*Adaptive Base Error Model for Ultra-deep Sequencing data*) is a NGS-based computational method that uses control samples to build global and local sequencing error reference models that are then used to improve the detection of somatic SNVs in cfDNA samples.

## Computational workflow
In [`step 1`](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Usage#1-compute-the-per-base-error-model) and [`step 2`](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Usage#2-compute-allelic-fraction-thresholds) only **control samples** are used to build the per-base error model and compute both coverage-dependent and coverage-independent allelic fraction thresholds. In [`step 3`](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Usage#3-call-somatic-snvs-in-case-samples) **tumor samples** are inspected and somatic snvs are called based on both custom filtering criteria (i.e. minimum coverage, minimum number of reads supporting an alternative allele) and allelic fraction thresholds. Then in [`step 4`](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Usage#4-filter-somatic-snvs-using-the-per-base-error-model), the per-base error model computed in `step 1` is exploited to further refine the final set of putative somatic snvs. Finally, output table with snvs calls can be formatted to get functional annotations by external tools (i.e. Oncotator).<br/>
> The described workflow can be found in [test_example.R](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/blob/master/test_example.R) and you can run it on the [test dataset](https://github.com/cibiobcg/abemus_models#test-dataset).<br/>  

Since the following inputs are used in all the main steps, you can initialise them just once at the beginning of your script:  
```R
# inputs
outdir <-  "/my_project/Abemus_analysis/"
sample.info.file <- "/my_project/info/sample_info_file.tsv"
targetbed <- "/my_project/info/regions.bed"
pacbamfolder_bychrom <- "/my_project/data/PaCBAM_outdir_bychrom"
```
`outdir` : The main directory that will be populated with subfolders and data files generated during each step.<br/> 
`targetbp` : The folder where you created `TargetPositions_chr.RData` data as described [here]    
`sample_info_file.tsv` : The info file formatted as described [here](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Input-data#sample-info-file).<br/>
`pacbamfolder_bychrom` : The path to the folder where you created the per-base pileup data split by chromosome for each sample as described [here](https://github.com/ncasiraghi/rpabemus/wiki/Input-data#split-pileup-and-pabs-data-by-chromosome).
<br/>
<br/>
The structure of the `outdir` folder will be:
```
Abemus_analysis/
   BaseErrorModel/
      pbem_tab.RData
      bperr_summary.RData
      pbem_background.RData
      afgtz.tsv
      afz.RData
   Controls/
      datathreshold.RData
      minaf_cov_corrected.RData
   Results/
      TUMOR_id
         pmtab_F1_TUMOR_id.tsv
         pmtab_F2_TUMOR_id.tsv
         pmtab_F3_TUMOR_id.tsv
         pmtab_F3_R_TUMOR_id.tsv
         pmtab_F3_optimalR_TUMOR_id.tsv
      ...
```

### 1. Compute the per-base error model
Control samples listed in the `sample.info.file` are used to compute the GSE distribution, the coverage-based GSE distributions and the per-base error model.
```R
outpbem <- compute_pbem(sample.info.file = sample.info.file,
                        af_max_to_compute_pbem = 0.2,
                        coverage_min_to_compute_pbem = 10,
                        coverage_binning = 50,
                        af_max_to_compute_thresholds = 0.2,
                        coverage_min_to_compute_thresholds = 10,
                        targetbed = targetbed,
                        outdir = outdir,
                        pacbamfolder_bychrom = pacbamfolder_bychrom)
# outs
head( outpbem$pbem_tab )
outpbem$bperr_summary
outpbem$bgpbem
outpbem$mean_pbem

# info and params
?compute_pbem()
```
By using this setting (default), the per-base error model will be computed using only positions with allelic fraction < 0.2 (`af_max_to_compute_pbem`) and coverage > 10 (`coverage_min_to_compute_pbem`). Similarly, the GSE distribution will be built using only positions with allelic fraction < 0.2 (`af_max_to_compute_thresholds`) and coverage > 10 (`coverage_min_to_compute_thresholds`). Coverage-dependent GSE distributions are computed by grouping together positions accordingly with the `coverage_binning` parameter.    

`outpbem$pbem_tab` : The main output is a data frame reporting for each targeted position the coverage information collected across the set of control samples (i.e. total coverage, number of reads supporting the reference and alternative alleles). column `bperr` indicates the per-base sequencing error observed at that position.<br/>
`outpbem$bperr_summary` : The `summary()` of the per-base sequencing error distribution.<br/>
`outpbem$bperr_tabstat` : The background per-base sequencing error values.<br/>
Data for GSE distributions are saved in files `afgtz.tsv` and `afz.RData` and stored in the default out folder `file.path( outdir, "BaseErrorModel" )`.<br/>
> All outs from the `compute_pbem()` function are automatically saved as `.RData` or tab-delimited files in the default out folder `file.path( outdir, "BaseErrorModel" )`. You can indicate the name of a different out folder using the parameter `outdir.bperr.name`, so that your outputs will be in `file.path( outdir, outdir.bperr.name )`.

### 2. Compute allelic fraction thresholds
Data created in `step 1` are used here to compute allelic fractions thresholds. The `compute_afthreshold()` function will look for `afgtz.tsv` and `afz.RData` data in the `pbem_dir` (as for `step 1` the default directory is `file.path(outdir,"BaseErrorModel")`, indicate a different path if you want to use a different folder).
```R
outafth <- compute_afthreshold(outdir = outdir,
                               pbem_dir = file.path(outdir,"BaseErrorModel"),
                               coverage_binning = 50) # ! the same used in compute_pbem()

# outs
head( outafth$th_results )
head( outafth$th_results_bin )

# info and params
?compute_afthreshold()
```
`outafth$th_results` : The array of coverage-independent allelic fraction thresholds. Each value of the array is an allelic fraction threshold computed using a range of detection specifities (`names( outafth$th_results )`).    
`outafth$th_results_bin` : The matrix of detection.specifity x bins_of_coverage. Each value is the coverage-dependent allelic fraction threshold to use given the coverage of a position and a desired `detection.specificity`.<br/>  
> All outs from the `compute_afthreshold()` function are automatically saved as `datathreshold.RData` file in the default out folder `file.path( outdir, "Controls" )`. You can indicate the name of a different out folder using the parameter `outdir.afth.name`, so that your outputs will be in `file.path( outdir, outdir.afth.name )`.

### 3. Call somatic snvs in tumor samples
Tumor samples listed in the sample sample.info.file are here investigated to look for somatic snvs. The `callsnvs()` uses data generated in `step 1`, `step 2`. Indicate the `pbem_dir` and the `controls_dir` accordingly with data that you want to use for the `step 3`.     
```R
calls <- callsnvs(sample.info.file = sample.info.file,
                  controls_dir = file.path(outdir,"Controls"),
                  pbem_dir = file.path(outdir,"BaseErrorModel"),
                  detection.specificity = 0.995,
                  outdir=outdir,
                  outdir.calls.name = "Results",
                  targetbed = targetbed,
                  pacbamfolder_bychrom=pacbamfolder_bychrom)

head( calls$tabsnvs_index )

# info and params
?callsnvs()
```
First, custom filtering criteria are applied to the per-base pileup data. For example, by default only positions with coverage > 10 in tumor sample are considered in the next steps. Find out more details about custom params `mincov`, `mincovgerm`, `minalt` and `maxafgerm` by using `?callsnvs()`. Positions passing first filtering criteria are saved in the tab-delimited table `pmtab_F1_CASE_id.tsv`.<br/>
Second, coverage-dependent allelic fraction thresholds (`AFbycov = TRUE` by default) computed in `step 2` are applied on positions included in `pmtab_F1_CASE_id.tsv`. Positions passing also the allelic fraction based filtering criteria are saved in the tab-delimited table `pmtab_F2_CASE_id.tsv`.<br/>
Third, each retained position is annotated with the corresponding `bperr` and the `filter.pbem_coverage` value is computed considering its coverage. The annotated (_but not filtered_) table is saved as `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv`.<br/>   
`calls$tabsnvs_index` : The `sample.info.file` with 3 additional columns indicating for each tumor sample the path to `pmtab_F1_CASE_id.tsv`, `pmtab_F2_CASE_id.tsv` and `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv`, respectively.
> All outs from the `callsnvs()` function are automatically saved as tab-delimited files in the default out folder `file.path( outdir, "Results" )`. You can indicate the name of a different out folder using the parameter `outdir.calls.name`, so that your outputs will be in `file.path( outdir, outdir.calls.name )`.

### 4. Filter somatic snvs using the per-base error model
For each `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv` table listed in the `tabindex` data frame, the `apply_scaling_factor()` function adjusts, as specified by the factor `R`, and applies the `bperr`-based filter (column `filter.pbem_coverage` in `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv`) to get the final list of putative somatic snvs that will be saved in table `pmtab_F3_R_CASE_id.tsv`.<br/>
There are two options to filter the `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv` using the `apply_scaling_factor()` function.

### option 1 : custom factor R 
You can select a custom scaling factor `R` (default: `R = 1`). The higher the scaling factor the higher is the cut-off applied. 
```R
# option 1

tabindex <- calls$tabsnvs_index

calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact <- apply_scaling_factor(tabindex = tabindex,
                                                     R = 0.5 )

head( calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact )
```
`calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact` : in `option 1` the function will return the `tabindex` data frame with 1 additional column indicating for each tumor sample the path to the filtered table `pmtab_F3_[R]_CASE_id.tsv` by using the specified factor `R`

### option 2 : optimal factor R
`rpabemus` enables the automatic selection of the R factor (among the ones generated from optimisation analysis) that best fits the case sample's mean coverage and target size. 
```R
# option 2

tabindex <- calls$tabsnvs_index

# compute case samples mean coverage
tabindex <- get_case_mean_coverage(tabindex = tabindex,
                                   pacbamfolder_bychrom = pacbamfolder_bychrom)

# compute target size
target_size <- get_target_size(targetbed = targetbed, Mbp = TRUE)

calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact <- apply_scaling_factor(tabindex = tabindex,
                                                     target_size = target_size,
                                                     use.optimal.R = TRUE,

head( calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact )

# info and params
?apply_scaling_factor()
```
`calls$tabsnvs_index_scalfact` : in `option 2` the function will return the `tabindex` table with 2 additional columns indicating for each tumor sample the path to the filtered table `pmtab_F3_optimalR_CASE_id.tsv` (column `tabcalls_f3_optimalR`) by using the optimal scaling factor `R` as reported in the column `tabcalls_f3_optimalR_used`.

> In both options, all outs from the apply_scaling_factor() function are automatically saved as tab-delimited files in the same folder where original `pmtab_F3_CASE_id.tsv` tables are located as indicated in the `tabindex` data frame.
